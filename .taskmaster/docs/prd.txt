# Product Requirements Document: Automated Dashboard Testing Suite

**Author:** Roo, Technical Leader
**Date:** June 28, 2025
**Status:** Proposed

---

### 1. Introduction & Objective

This document outlines the requirements for an automated testing suite for the `dashboard_generator.py` script. The script dynamically generates an HTML and JavaScript-based financial dashboard. Due to the generative nature of the output, it is critical to have an automated way to verify its functional integrity.

The primary objective of this project is to build a reliable, automated process that:
1.  Runs the dashboard generator.
2.  Launches the generated dashboard in a real browser.
3.  Performs checks to ensure the dashboard is free of critical errors, such as broken JavaScript and invalid links.

This will provide confidence that changes to the generator or its inputs do not negatively impact the end-user experience.

### 2. User Personas

| Persona | Description | Needs & Goals |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Developer / Maintainer** | The software engineer responsible for maintaining and extending the `analyst_dashboard` project. | Needs a fast and reliable way to confirm that their code changes have not broken the dashboard's functionality. Wants to catch regressions automatically without tedious manual testing. |

### 3. Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FR-1** | **Execute Dashboard Generator** | As a developer, I want the test suite to automatically run the `DashboardGenerator`... | - The test suite must successfully invoke the `generate_dashboard()` method.<br>- The `dashboard.html` and `dashboard.js` files must be created in a designated output directory. |
| **FR-2** | **Serve Generated Files** | ...so that the generated files can be loaded in a browser under realistic conditions. | - The test suite must start a local HTTP server to serve the directory containing the generated files.<br>- The `dashboard.html` file must be accessible via a local URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/dashboard.html`). |
| **FR-3** | **Launch Browser** | As a developer, I want the test suite to launch a real browser... | - The test suite must use a browser automation tool (Playwright) to open a new browser window.<br>- The browser must successfully navigate to the URL of the locally served `dashboard.html`. |
| **FR-4** | **Check for Console Errors** | ...so that I can be sure the dashboard's JavaScript executes without errors. | - The test must fail if any uncaught JavaScript errors are logged to the browser's developer console.<br>- The test must pass if the console remains clean. |
| **FR-5** | **Verify Content Rendering** | As a developer, I want to verify that the dashboard has rendered basic content... | - The test must assert that the HTML `<body>` is not empty.<br>- The test must assert that the page's `<title>` has been set. |
| **FR-6** | **Validate Hyperlinks** | ...so that I can ensure all links on the page are valid and functional. | - The test must find all `<a>` elements on the rendered page.<br>- The test must fail if any `<a>` element has an empty, missing, or placeholder (`#`) `href` attribute. |

### 4. Technical Requirements & Workflow

The testing suite will be built using Python and integrated into the existing project structure.

**4.1. Technology Stack**
*   **Testing Framework:** `pytest`
*   **Asynchronous Test Handling:** `pytest-asyncio`
*   **Browser Automation:** `Playwright`
*   **Dependency Management:** A `requirements-test.txt` file will be created to manage testing-specific dependencies.

**4.2. Testing Workflow**

The automated test will follow this sequence:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Test Runner (pytest)
    participant DashboardGenerator
    participant Local Web Server
    participant Browser (Playwright)

    Test Runner (pytest)->>+DashboardGenerator: 1. Run generate_dashboard()
    DashboardGenerator-->>-Test Runner (pytest): Returns path to generated files

    Test Runner (pytest)->>+Local Web Server: 2. Start server for generated files
    Local Web Server-->>-Test Runner (pytest): Server running at http://localhost:8000

    Test Runner (pytest)->>+Browser (Playwright): 3. Launch browser
    Browser (Playwright)->>-Test Runner (pytest): Browser is ready

    Test Runner (pytest)->>Browser (Playwright): 4. Navigate to http://localhost:8000/dashboard.html
    Browser (Playwright)->>Local Web Server: Request dashboard.html
    Local Web Server-->>Browser (Playwright): Serve dashboard.html & dashboard.js
    Browser (Playwright)->>Test Runner (pytest): Page loaded

    Test Runner (pytest)->>Browser (Playwright): 5. Perform Checks & Assertions
    Note right of Browser (Playwright): - Check for console errors<br/>- Verify page content<br/>- Find all `<a>` tags<br/>- Validate `href` attributes

    Test Runner (pytest)->>+Local Web Server: 6. Stop server
    Test Runner (pytest)->>+Browser (Playwright): 7. Close browser
```

### 5. Success Metrics

*   The entire test suite runs to completion automatically via a single command (e.g., `pytest`).
*   The suite accurately reports a "pass" when the generated dashboard is free of console errors and has valid links.
*   The suite accurately reports a "fail" when a regression is introduced (e.g., a change that causes a JavaScript error).

### 6. Out of Scope

The following items are explicitly out of scope for this initial version:

*   **Visual Regression Testing:** Comparing screenshots to detect changes in the UI's appearance.
*   **Performance Testing:** Measuring page load times or rendering performance.
*   **Cross-Browser Testing:** While Playwright supports multiple browsers, the initial implementation will focus on a single browser (Chromium) for simplicity.
*   **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** This suite focuses on technical and functional correctness, not subjective user experience.
